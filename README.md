## 1. Welcome
Welcome to the AD9854 DDS based transceiver of low VHF project. This project is conducting under the ANU Engineering Program ENGN4200 Individual Project.


## 2. Project Description
The aim of this project is to design a low-cost radio transceiver of 70MHz, using the AD9854 Direct Digital Synthesiser and Raspberry Pi. The programming of synced signal will be done in C language. The transmission of samples is uniform in time.
The I and Q synthesizer function, or the RF signal, used for this research topic is: 

I(t)cosωt+Q(t)sinωt

For signal receiver, the version 3 RTL-SDR radio receiver dongle will be used, which samples a radio frequency signal from 50 MHz to 1700MHz and outputs interleaved 8-bit IQ samples at s symbol rate up to 2.4Msps.
