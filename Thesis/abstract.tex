The abstract should be brief (100-150 words) and directed to readers familiar with the broad area of the thesis subject. ``The abstract is of utmost importance for it is read by 10 to 500 times more people than hear or read the entire article. It should not be a mere recital of the subjects covered, replete with such expressions as ``is discussed'' and ``is described.'' It should be a condensation and concentration of the essential qualities of the paper.''
